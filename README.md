# sorting and searching algorithms visualization

Vid showing how it works 22/7/2020 version: https://youtu.be/yMG3x2RfGrk
Explanation of the program on the description of the video.

Sorting and searching algorithms visualization with python 3.8 and tkinter. The graphics are pretty bad I know, the purpose of this is the algorithm implementation.

There is a cronmeter and the data gets stored in MySQL database. So, I can compare between algorithms doing some statistics.

The main file is the sort_alg.py. The others are algorithms. 

The pre folder contains files with programs that creates arrays. They get stored in the 'pre_something' variable (the pre15 contains 15 numbers, the pre30 30 numbers) so you can compare the timing with the same array but different algorithms.

Thanks for checking it out.
