Sorting and searching algorithms visualization with python 3.8 and tkinter. The graphics are pretty bad I know, the purpose of this is the algorithm implementation.

There is a cronmeter and the data gets stored in MySQL database. So, I can compare between algorithms doing some statistics.

The main file is the sort_alg.py. The algs are in the algs folder. 

The pre folder contains files with programs that creates arrays. They get stored in the 'pre_something' variable (the pre15 contains 15 numbers, the pre30 30 numbers) so you can compare the timing with the same array but different algorithms.

The file sorting_algs_noDB.py is the same as the sort_algs.py but with the grafics compatible for all the computers and without a database, so you can run it on almost all the machines and displays.

Thanks for checking it out.
