# sorting and searching algorithms visualization

Sorting and searching algorithms visualization with python 3.8 and tkinter. The graphics are pretty bad I know, the putpose of this is the algorithm implementation.

There is a cronmeter and the data gets stored in MySQL database. So, I can compare between algorithms doing some statistics.

The main file is the sort_alg.py. The others are algorithms except the pre1.py. What this file does is to create arrays that get stored in the 'pre1' variable so you can compare the timing with the same array but different algorithms.


Thanks for checking it out.
